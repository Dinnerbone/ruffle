///
///  * AVM1 delivers broadcasts via `ClipEvent` or system listeners
///  * AVM2 delivers broadcasts to all registered `EventDispatcher`s
///  * Anycast events are not delivered to AVM2
///  * Targeted events are supported and consumed by both VMs
///  * AVM2 additionally supports bubble/capture, which AVM1 and
///    `InteractiveObject` itself does not support
